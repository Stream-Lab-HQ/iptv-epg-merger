# iptv-epg-merger

Merge multiple XMLTV EPG sources into one clean deduplicated guide.

[![CI](https://github.com/Stream-Lab-HQ/iptv-epg-merger/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Stream-Lab-HQ/iptv-epg-merger/actions)

## Why this exists

Merge multiple XMLTV EPG sources into one deduplicated guide. Auto-gunzip, channel-ID normalization, timezone fold.

This is part of an open-source toolkit we maintain across [9 sibling
organizations](#sister-organization-tools-sibling-repos-in-the-streaming-research-network)
to support our IPTV testing rig. Editorial work lives at
[StreamReviewHQ](https://streamreviewhq.com/) and our recommended provider
is [IPTVTheOne](https://iptvtheone.com).

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stream-Lab-HQ/iptv-epg-merger.git
cd iptv-epg-merger
# Python 3.10+, stdlib only (no pip install needed)
```

## Usage

```bash
python iptv_epg_merger.py epg1.xml epg2.xml.gz --out merged.xml --normalize-channel-ids
```

Run `python iptv_epg_merger.py --help` for all options.

## How it works

See the docstring at the top of [`iptv_epg_merger.py`](./iptv_epg_merger.py) —
the methodology is the same one used in our 90-day provider testing rig.
